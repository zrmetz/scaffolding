# Project Scaffolding Template

**A ready-to-use project template with quality gates built in.**

## Problem This Solves

LLM-assisted development fails by silently expanding scope, degrading quality, and losing architectural intent.

This scaffold exists to make those failures **impossible without explicit acknowledgement**.

It's not a productivity framework. It's damage control infrastructure - automated enforcement that catches drift before it ships.

## Quick Start

1. Click **"Use this template"** → **"Create a new repository"**
2. Clone your new repo
3. Run `npm install` to install dependencies
4. Run `npm run precommit` to verify everything works
5. Open with Claude Code - it reads `CLAUDE.md` and continues setup

## What's Included

│   └── e2e/                       ← E2E tests (web apps)
└── [Config files]
    ├── tsconfig.json          ← Strict TypeScript
    ├── eslint.config.js       ← Linting rules
    ├── .prettierrc            ← Formatting rules
    ├── vitest.config.ts       ← Unit test config
    ├── playwright.config.ts   ← E2E test config (web apps)
    └── .gitignore             ← Standard ignores
```

### Enforcement

| Where | What | When |
|-------|------|------|
| **Local** | Pre-commit hooks (`.husky/`) | Before each commit |
| **Remote** | GitHub Actions (`.github/workflows/`) | On push and PR |

Bad code is blocked at both levels.

## Bootstrap Order

First session only - see `docs/BOOTSTRAP.md` for full details:

| Step | What | Why |
|------|------|-----|
| 0 | Git + GitHub | Version control before anything |
| 1 | Identify project type | Web/API/CLI/Library/Script |
| 2 | Core quality gates | Tests, lint, types, hooks |
| 3 | Language-specific setup | TS/Python/Rust/Go |
| 4 | Web-specific (if applicable) | E2E testing |
| 5 | Enable CI checks | After adding source code |

## Supported Project Types

| Type | Examples | What Gets Set Up |
|------|----------|------------------|
| Web App | React, Vue, Next.js | Full (tests + E2E + lint) |
| API/Backend | Express, FastAPI | Tests + lint |
| CLI Tool | Node CLI, Python script | Tests + lint |
| Library | npm package, Python module | Tests + lint + build |
| Desktop | Electron, Tauri | Full |
| Script | Automation, cron jobs | Minimal (lint) |

## Supported Languages

- TypeScript/JavaScript (Node.js)
- Python
- Rust
- Go

## Quality Gates (Enforced on Every Commit)

| Check | What It Catches |
|-------|-----------------|
| `typecheck` | Type errors |
| `lint` | Code style violations |
| `check:file-length` | Files > 300 lines |
| `test` | Broken tests, missing inventory |

## After Using This Template

1. Replace `[Project Name]` placeholders in docs
2. Fill in `CLAUDE.md` → Project Summary section
3. Update `ARCHITECTURE.md` with your structure
4. Delete this README and write your own (or keep the structure)
