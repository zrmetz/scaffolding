## [Unreleased]

### Added
- Initial project scaffolding
- Documentation structure (CLAUDE.md, docs/, tasks/)
- **Environment documentation:** `docs/DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md` for servers, ports, startup order
- **Troubleshooting guide:** `docs/TROUBLESHOOTING.md` with debugging methodology as opening requirement
- **Debugging methodology sections:** Clean Slate First, Multi-Service Debugging
- **Health check guidance:** Functional checks vs health checks distinction in DEV_ENVIRONMENT.md
- **Rule 13 (Governance):** CLAUDE.md is now a protected file requiring human approval
- **Pre-commit hook:** Blocks CLAUDE.md changes, requires `--no-verify` after human review
- **Glossary:** `docs/GLOSSARY.md` with terminology definitions (session, burst, context, checkpoint, etc.)
- **Before Writing New Code:** Search-first checklist in CONTRIBUTING.md with common patterns to look for
- **API Property Troubleshooting:** Known issue entry for "property doesn't exist" casing problems
- **Estimate Before Adding:** Line count estimation guidance before adding significant code

### Changed
- **Before Committing Checklist:** Expanded to include all documentation files, organized by category (core, user-facing, technical, learning, planning)
- **Rules 1 & 2:** Now explicitly trigger on compaction (re-read governance files after context compaction)
- **Prediction Protocol:** DOING/EXPECT/RESULT pattern added to TROUBLESHOOTING.md
- **Staging Discipline:** "git add . is forbidden" formalized in CONTRIBUTING.md
- **Batch Size:** "3 actions, then checkpoint" - more aggressive verification cadence
- **Completion Bias Warning:** Added to CLAUDE.md preamble

### Documented
- **Completion Bias Patterns:** LESSONS-LEARNED entry documenting three failure modes - skipped prediction protocol, code duplication before reuse check, reactive file splits
